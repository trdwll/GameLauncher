## Why
Mostly to learn Qt since I've never used it, but also to help other developers learn how a system like this is implemented.

## Projects
- GameLauncher - The actual game launcher that players will download and use to play your video game.
- GameLauncherPatcher - This is a gui app for patching your project/video game. 
- LoginAPI - This is a simple Django project for authentication in the launcher.

## Usage
