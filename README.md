# GameLauncher
__A simple game launcher and patcher written in C++ using Qt5.__

## Why
Mostly to learn Qt since I've never used it, but also to help other developers learn how a system like this is implemented.

## Projects
- GameLauncher - The actual game launcher that players will download and use to play your video game.
- GameLauncherPatcher - This is a gui app for patching your project/video game. 
- LoginAPI - This is a simple Django project for authentication in the launcher. __DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!__

## Usage
See the wiki.
